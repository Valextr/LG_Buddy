# User Guide

This guide covers the parts of LG Buddy that users may want after installation: commands, configuration, and desktop-idle behavior.

## Runtime Commands

The installed runtime command is:

```bash
lg-buddy <command>
```

Available commands:

- `startup [auto|boot|wake]`
- `shutdown`
- `sleep-pre`
- `sleep`
- `nm-pre-down`
- `brightness`
- `screen-off`
- `screen-on`
- `monitor`
- `lifecycle`
- `detect-backend`
- `settings`

Examples:

```bash
lg-buddy detect-backend
lg-buddy settings list
lg-buddy monitor
lg-buddy brightness
```

In normal use, systemd starts the relevant commands automatically. Most users
only need `brightness`, `settings`, or `configure.sh`.

`lifecycle`, `nm-pre-down`, `sleep-pre`, and `startup wake` are normally
service-owned system lifecycle commands. They are documented for
troubleshooting, not day-to-day manual use.

## Desktop Idle Monitoring

LG Buddy supports two session backends:

- `gnome`
- `swayidle`

`screen_backend=auto` prefers GNOME when the current session satisfies the full GNOME contract, then falls back to `swayidle` if installed.

The GNOME backend requires:

- GNOME Shell
- `org.gnome.ScreenSaver`
- `org.gnome.Mutter.IdleMonitor`

The monitor runtime keeps one persistent session-bus connection open for GNOME
shell detection, ScreenSaver signals, and Mutter idletime polling.

When the GNOME backend is active, LG Buddy also watches readable Linux gamepad
input devices and treats controller activity as user activity. This is automatic
and has no configuration switch. Devices are discovered at monitor startup,
refreshed when Linux reports input-device add, remove, or change events, and
periodically reconciled so hot-plugged controllers can be picked up without
restarting the service. Standard controllers are read through evdev. The
Logitech G923 also has a raw HID fallback for wheel and pedal activity that is
not exposed as evdev events on some Linux hosts.

Gamepad activity detection requires the user session running
`LG_Buddy_screen.service` to have read access to the relevant `/dev/input/event*`
and, for the G923 fallback, `/dev/hidraw*` nodes. On normal desktop sessions this
is typically granted by logind/udev seat ACLs.

Check the user-session monitor:

```bash
systemctl --user status LG_Buddy_screen.service
```

Temporarily force a backend:

```bash
systemctl --user edit LG_Buddy_screen.service
```

Then add:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=LG_BUDDY_SCREEN_BACKEND=gnome
```

Supported values are `auto`, `gnome`, and `swayidle`.

For backend semantics and implementation details, see [session-backend-model.md](session-backend-model.md).

## System Sleep And Wake

Default installs enable system sleep/wake TV control through:

```bash
systemctl status LG_Buddy_lifecycle.service
```

The installed lifecycle path has two Linux event sources:

- a NetworkManager `pre-down` dispatcher hook gates network teardown and checks
  logind `PreparingForSleep`
- `LG_Buddy_lifecycle.service` listens to logind `PrepareForSleep(false)` for
  resume restore

When NetworkManager reports `pre-down` and logind says the system is preparing
for sleep, LG Buddy runs pre-sleep TV power-off before the interface is torn
down. Ordinary network disconnects return quickly. After resume, the lifecycle
service runs wake restore policy and clears the sleep-attempt marker.

While system sleep is pending, session idle/activity events do not run screen
blank or restore TV commands. This avoids racing session-level TV control
against the lifecycle sleep path.

LG Buddy does not install the old sleep and wake systemd oneshot handlers or the
old NetworkManager sleep hook. The installer and uninstaller remove those legacy
artifacts from existing installs so there is only one system lifecycle owner.

## Configuration

To inspect structured settings after installation:

```bash
lg-buddy settings list
lg-buddy settings describe screen.restore_policy
lg-buddy settings get screen.idle_timeout
```

To change supported screen settings:

```bash
lg-buddy settings set screen.idle_timeout 600
lg-buddy settings set screen.restore_policy aggressive
lg-buddy settings unset screen.restore_policy
```

`set` and `unset` write `config.env` and then apply screen-monitor settings by
restarting `LG_Buddy_screen.service` when the user service is installed and
active or enabled. If the user service is missing or disabled, the value remains
saved and applies when that service is installed or started.

To rerun full setup for TV IP, MAC address, HDMI input, or install-time service
wiring:

```bash
./configure.sh
```

The settings CLI, configurator, installer, and manual edits all use the same
`config.env` file. It is resolved from:

- `LG_BUDDY_CONFIG`, if set
- otherwise `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/lg-buddy/config.env`
- otherwise `~/.config/lg-buddy/config.env`

Current config keys:

- `tv_ip`
- `tv_mac`
- `input`
- `screen_backend`
- `screen_idle_timeout`
- `screen_restore_policy`
- `system_sleep_wake_policy`

Current structured settings:

| Setting key | `config.env` key | Operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `screen.backend` | `screen_backend` | `get`, `describe`, `set`, `unset` |
| `screen.idle_timeout` | `screen_idle_timeout` | `get`, `describe`, `set`, `unset` |
| `screen.restore_policy` | `screen_restore_policy` | `get`, `describe`, `set`, `unset` |
| `system.sleep_wake_policy` | `system_sleep_wake_policy` | `get`, `describe`, `set`, `unset` |

`screen_idle_timeout` is the inactivity threshold in seconds used by the session monitor.
LG Buddy currently uses that timeout for both the GNOME and `swayidle` backends.

`screen_restore_policy` controls how aggressively LG Buddy reclaims the display on wake and user activity:

- `conservative`: default behavior, only restore when an LG Buddy marker says it previously blanked or powered off the TV
- `aggressive`: attempt restore on session wake/activity and system wake even without a marker

`marker_only` is still accepted as a legacy alias for `conservative`.

`system_sleep_wake_policy` controls automatic system sleep/wake TV handling:

- `enabled`: default behavior, let the installed NetworkManager pre-down gate
  and logind lifecycle service control the TV around system sleep and wake
- `disabled`: leave lifecycle integration installed, but make those commands
  no-op for sleep/wake TV handling

The running lifecycle service rereads config and suppresses actions while this
value is `disabled`. The NetworkManager pre-down hook also reads config on each
invocation, so `lg-buddy settings set system.sleep_wake_policy <value>` changes
runtime policy without reinstalling services.

Example:

```ini
screen_idle_timeout=300
screen_restore_policy=aggressive
system_sleep_wake_policy=enabled
```

Installed services receive the resolved config path through `LG_BUDDY_CONFIG`.

## Uninstall

To remove LG Buddy:

```bash
chmod +x ./uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

This removes the installed services, desktop entry, Rust runtime binary, Python TV-control environment, and optionally the user config file.
